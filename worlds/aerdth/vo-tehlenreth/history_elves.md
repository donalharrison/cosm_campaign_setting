In those days, the elves fostered amicable relations with most mortal races. As intrepid explorers and dedicated professors, they shared the vast knowledge they had accumulated with other civilizations they deemed less fortunate. The elves sought teachings from races who had mastered lore and methods foreign to their own, engaging in cultural exchanges that deepened the understanding between different societies.

When Erulen, the revered first Master of Forms, resolved to transcend beyond the material plane, she envisioned a system to ensure the continuity of wise leadership among the elves. She set forth the means to determine her successor and all those who would lead the elves in the future. This process of becoming Turu Len, a Master of Forms, involved an aspirant attaining mastery in three of the Ten Forms, much like Erulen herself had achieved. The Ten Forms encompassed a diverse array of disciplines, including martial arts, elemental manipulation, healing arts, celestial divination, and more. Each Form represented a profound aspect of elven culture and heritage, and the mastery of three was a testament to an elf's dedication and understanding of their people's legacy.

Becoming a Turu Len was not merely a matter of personal ambition; it symbolized a deep connection to the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire and a commitment to the well-being and prosperity of all elves. The process to obtain mastery in the Ten Forms was rigorous, requiring not only extraordinary skill but also spiritual enlightenment. Aspiring Turu Len would embark on pilgrimages to sacred sites, seek guidance from ancient mentors, and face trials that tested their mettle and resolve.

Upon achieving mastery in three Forms, the elf would undertake the Trials of Turu which would discern the elf's readiness to assume the mantle of leadership. If deemed worthy, the newly anointed Turu Len would be recognized as the high-leader of all elves dedicated to the empire. They would inherit the responsibilities, wisdom, and the great legacy of Erulen, ushering in a new era of guidance, enlightenment, and unity for the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire.

For 200 years following Erulen’s departure, the empire continued to prosper, but without the rule of an emperor, the Elf Lords led their realms to their own devices. The elves incited wars to expand their reach. They clashed with rival empires and other mortal races, leaving trails of conquest and bloodshed in their wake. This era, known as the Age of Unbridled Ambition, saw the elves driven by individual desires for power and dominance, rather than a unified vision for their civilization.

After this period of strife and fragmentation, a figure emerged to unite the elves once more. Tanithil S’aer of the Vallinde, a skilled and charismatic leader, called the imperial banners to assert his rite to rule. Tanithil proved his mastery of the Dawns, Clouds, and Dreams, three of the Ten Forms, and was named Rhylen — the second Master of Forms.

Rhylen’s ascent, however, was not received harmoniously across the empire. The wild and fiercely independent Hravani had grown fond of their autonomy and had no interest in submitting to further rule, leading to clashes with Rhylen's forces. The ensuing Hravani Rebellion tested Rhylen's leadership, but he managed to quell the unrest by finding a peaceful solution that ratified the wilde elves independence from the empire.

The Ranor, a subrace of elves known for their cautious and discerning nature, grew suspicious of a Vallinde dynasty, as both Erulen and Rhylen had ascended from high-elf lineage. They questioned the concentration of power within a single line and demanded greater representation in the empire's leadership. To appease the Ranor, Rhylen implemented a council system, comprising representatives from various subraces, to offer counsel and balance the distribution of power with the Master of Forms at its head.

Meanwhile, the elves of Gwaerenhost, who held an enigmatic reverence for their connection to the cosmos, drew prophecies warning that basking in the light of Aerdth’s Suns would see the elves reduced to squalor. Fearing the fulfillment of this ominous prophecy, they departed from the surface and ventured into the depths of the world, seeking new domains underground. They transformed their abandoned surface cities into majestic spires, hidden beneath the earth. The elves of Gwaerenhost became known as the Nhul-ar, meaning "those who dwell below," by their former brethren, who referred to them as the dark elves.

The Sereg-ar blood sorcerers also departed the empire during this time.  They sought to unearth the mysteries of Aerdth’s place in the Cosm and settled within the Xos Archipelago where the Suns’ light is said to reveal powers beyond understanding. 

Despite the challenges and divisions, Rhylen's reign as the second Master of Forms marked a turning point in the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire's history. Under his leadership, the elves rediscovered a sense of unity and purpose, seeking to explore and understand the world beyond their borders while preserving their ancient traditions and knowledge. The empire began to thrive once again, embracing the lessons learned from its tumultuous past and forging a path towards a more enlightened and harmonious future.

After a century of Rhylen’s rule, the role of Turu Len was contested.  Helexidor Ravay of the Ranor took on the Trials of Turu attaining mastery of the Horizons, Dreams, Nights, and Spirits. Ravay’s display made clear his superiority in the Forms compared to Rhylen. Rhylen was forced to step down, and Ravay was named Ohlen, the Third Master of Forms.

The Miurdan, distrusting Ranor ambition, objected to the new rule. They abdicated their place in the empire and withdrew into the mountains of Eredrest, establishing a secluded domain in the heart of the rugged peaks.

The Ehelon, yearning for exploration beyond the confines of Aerdth, grew restless and sought dispensation to claim domain in Sideria, the plane of stars. They wished to transcend the boundaries of the material world and learn from the celestial bodies that adorned the night sky.

Seeing this as an opportunity to reduce the number of factions who could depose his rule, Ohlen granted the Ehelon leave to sail the sea between worlds. They constructed magnificent starships infused with eldritch magic, setting forth into the vast unknown of the cosmic realm, leaving Aerdth behind.

With mankind beginning to expand their borders further into the wilderness of Aerdth, the Erynor elves of the forests receded into their woodland fortresses, seeking to protect their sacred groves from human encroachment. Ohlen gave the Erynor permission to war against any beings of non-elven blood they dubbed a threat. Thus began a series of skirmishes and territorial disputes between the Erynor and human settlers, shaping the borders of the elven territories and the human realms for generations to come.

He named the Ithindi grey elves the main fighting force of the empire, entrusting them with the duty to safeguard the Vo-Tehlenreth realms. Their skill and discipline in combat, honed through years of training, made them formidable warriors and guardians of elven society.

Under Ohlen's rule, the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire entered an era of exploration and political dominion. The elves' influence extended not only across the surface of Aerdth but also into the realms beyond, each subrace finding their own unique path as they ventured into uncharted territories. However, unknown to the elves, these decisions would sow the seeds of future conflicts and alliances that would shape the fate of Aerdth for centuries to come.

Ohlen ruled over the empire for nearly 4 centuries, amassing incredible power and solidifying the elves as the foremost force of mortalkin in Aerdth.  Under his command, the Vo-Tehlenreth elves took on legendary feats, etching their names in the annals of history.  They embarked on daring quests, slaying mythical beasts that once terrorized the realms. From colossal serpents lurking in the oceans to ancient dragons that plagued the skies, the elves demonstrated their prowess in vanquishing these awe-inspiring adversaries.

The thirst for knowledge led the elves to delve into powerful magic, even delving into the dark arts. While they sought to harness their magical potential for the good of the empire, manyof their experiments strayed into forbidden territories, testing the boundaries between light and shadow.  They shaped monstrous creatures to be used as beasts of burden and war, some of which now stalk the untamed parts of Aerdth.

However, as mankind grew in power and ambition, the elves found themselves warring against humans who sought to expand their borders. Ohlen saw human thriving as a threat to his dominance, fearing that their rapid growth would challenge the elves' supremacy over Aerdth. Battles erupted along the borders, and the elves fought with unyielding tenacity to maintain their territorial sovereignty.

Amidst these feats, the Ithindi who formed the main fighting force of the empire, experienced a bitter conflict within themselves. Though they reveled in the thrill of battle, they began to resent their role as enforcers, eternally burdened with the duty of safeguarding elven interests. Countless Ithindi warriors fell in the line of duty, and their families mourned the sacrifices made on behalf of the empire.

The prolonged wars and Ohlen's thirst for power began to create divisions among the elven subraces. Some elves questioned the cost of maintaining dominance and the toll it took on their brethren. Others started to reconsider their isolationist stance, contemplating the merits of engaging in diplomacy and cooperation with the other mortal races rather than resorting to constant conflict.

As Ohlen's rule stretched on, whispers of dissent grew louder within the empire. While the Vo-Tehlenreth continued to be revered across Aerdth, the cracks in the once united elven empire began to show, sowing seeds of doubt and uncertainty about the future of their once-glorious civilization.  Ohlen resolved to reaffirm elven supremacy and maintain his grip on power.

In a show of dominance, he ordered Nevieshara Thilese, Queen of the Telun-ar (Sky Elves), to conquer Kviol, the Hell Plane of Unending Death. The Sky Queen led her elven host across Kviol to extinguish the fire of affliction and rid the plane of its malevolent inhabitants. The elf queen's crusade culminated in a legendary battle against Sigdramuth the Desecator, a monstrous lord of the infernal realm. In a remarkable display of prowess, Nevieshara engaged Sigdramuth in single combat and emerged victorious, banishing the devlirous entity from Kviol. However, their victory came at a great cost, as most of the Sky Elves perished in the brutal conflict. Their numbers remain diminished to this day, and the sacrifice of the Sky Elves is forever etched in elven lore.

Ohlen was pleased to see another of the noble lines of elves in decline, using the event to propagandize the might and martyrdom of the elves. He manipulated the narrative to emphasize elven strength and the necessity of subjugating other races to maintain elven supremacy.

Continuing his quarrel with humans, Ohlen had his forces begin to enslave human prisoners of war. As tensions escalated, he discovered half-elf progeny, thought to be anathema to elven tradition. Exploiting this belief, Caelen forced these half-breeds into service, seeing them as tools to be utilized in his quest for dominance.

In a disturbing twist, the Ranor discovered a ritual to breed Orcs with humans, creating a hybrid race known as the Quarry-Breed. The Quarry-Breed were bred to serve as the perfect prey for training elven hunters in battle, fostering an unsettling and exploitative dynamic within the empire.

At the peak of unrest, Ohlen ordered the Ithindi to capture Coriss, a burgeoning human kingdom at the south end of the Viran Sea. He commanded the Ithindi to slay all humans of noble lineage, believing that doing so would quell any future uprising against elven rule. However, the Grey Queen, leader of the Ithindi, refused this task, recognizing that Coriss posed no legitimate threat to the Vo-Telenreth Empire.

Defying Ohlen’s orders, the Grey Queen challenged him to a duel of blades, declaring her intention to fight for the independence and integrity of the Ithindi. In the duel, it became evident that Caelen was no match for the Grey Queen's superior combat skills. However, before the duel could conclude, she succumbed to poison, raising suspicions about Ohlen's involvement and leading to further unrest among the Ithindi.

Ohlen’s actions, while consolidating power, came at great costs, both in terms of elven lives and internal unity. The empire, once a beacon of knowledge and unity, now faced growing dissent and opposition, and the shadows  cast of his decisions forged long-lasting impacts on the fate of the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire and the elves of Aerdth.

In the 382nd year of his reign, Ohlen, feeling the weight of time upon him, announced his intentions to abdicate the throne. He called for the elven realms to name those who would attempt the trials of Forms, seeking a worthy successor to lead the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire.

Ohlen named his daughter Soora Ravay as the Ranor representative. The Vallinde, Oror, and Erynor all named their own representatives for the trials. However, to the surprise of many, only Soora was present to attempt the trials, as the other representatives had perished or disappeared under strange circumstances.

The young Ranor, Soora, successfully attained mastery of three Forms, excelling in her physical prowess, arcane knowledge, and understanding of the celestial arts. In recognition of her achievement, her father named her Caelen, the fourth Master of Forms. While her ascent brought hope to some, it also furthered the sinister ambitions of the increasingly covetous empire.

During Caelen’s rule, ominous signs began to manifest across the realm. The Black Sun disappeared from the sky, casting a sense of unease and restlessness among the Oror elves. Their once-unwavering connection to celestial forces waned, leaving them perplexed and questioning the source of this disturbance.

The elves continued to wage wars against mankind, attempting to keep them from growing their strength and encroaching further upon elven territories. As the conflicts escalated, a growing sentiment of discontent permeated the lands.

In a bold move, Idhrenion Evindal, now the Grey King and leader of the Ithindi, declared independence from the empire. He vehemently stated that no tyrant shall command the allegiance of the Ithinidi, emphasizing their desire for autonomy and self-determination.

Hoping to tighten the Ranor grip on imperial sovereignty, Caelen sent the Vey-ar (Sea Elves) to sail in search of unknown shores, seeking to expand the empire's dominion across unexplored territories. However, their host never returned, and the Sea Elves are seldom seen in Aerdth today, their fate shrouded in mystery.

For a generation, Caelen’s rule propagated the empire's authority across the known world. However, her reign was finally challenged by Orometh Elenvir of the Oror. Having lived among and studied alongside masters across the elven realms, Orometh effortlessly exhibited his mastery of the Dawns, Horizons, Clouds, Roots, and Winds, showcasing an unparalleled understanding of elven heritage and traditions.

In a climactic confrontation, Caelen was forced to acknowledge Orometh's superiority in the Forms, realizing that her grasp on power was slipping. In a display of humility and strength, she ceded her rule to Orometh, ushering in a new era for the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire.

Orometh was named Vuhlen, the fifth Master of Forms, with the arduous task of trying to reunify the fracturing empire. However, he soon realized that the influence of the Ranor had caused too much damage, and the divisions among the elven subraces ran too deep. Vuhlen recognized that his legacy lay in disrupting the Ranor dynasty, for better or worse. Reunification would have to be left to a future leader with a stronger mandate and vision.

After ruling as emperor for a relatively short 123 years, Vuhlen achieved divine enlightenment and announced his ascension from Aerdth. His divine connection granted him mastery over the remaining five Forms during his reign, making him one of the most formidable elven leaders in history. With his transcendent wisdom, Vuhlen conceived a plan to ensure the next Master of Forms would be the most courageous and determined successor. He took the trappings of mastery and hid them behind powerful enchantments, sending them to unknown corners of the world.

With Vuhlen’s ascent, the empire faltered greatly as a shadow was growing in Aerdth.  Ixatrigan the Corruptor was amassing power to unleash upon life in Aerdth.  The Dragon Tyrant meant to consume the world and bring the end of all existence.  The Corruptor was as cunning as it was malicious.  The lords of the elf realms were invited to parley with the Dragon.  Only Thaladir the Lord of Vallinde, Serannor the Frost King, and Nimrothal of the Oror accepted the Corruptor’s invitation.  The details of their council are lost to history.  What is known is following the Dragon’s delegations, Serannor raised a great glacier in the sea of Khor and led his Dwin-ar elves behind an impenetrable wall of frigid cold, known now as the Hoarfrost Veil.  Queen Nimrielye took her most loyal subjects to the deserts of Kemreit, claiming the Pharaoh’s hand and eternal rule of the desert kingdom.  Thaladir, the Lord of Vallinde, never returned.

The weakened Vo-Telenreth took up arms alongside mortalkin to stand against the Dragon Tyrant, Ixatrigan the Corruptor, who unleashed its hordes upon the world. The beings of Aerdth looked to the elves, hoping that the legendary prowess of the elven empire would prove instrumental in defeating the seemingly invincible foe.

In a brilliant display of strategy, the Ranor devised a way to trap the unkillable Ixatrigan beyond the barriers of existence. They created powerful ritual scrolls, fueled by the combined might of elven magic and mortal determination, to sunder the Corruptor's essence and bind its parts to the Ina—the nothingness that existed beyond the boundaries of reality.

Having emerged victorious from the harrowing conflict known as the Corruptor's War, the elves were celebrated as heroes, and their valor and sacrifice were lauded throughout the realm. The Vallinde, however, grew increasingly distrustful of the Ranor, not knowing what other terrible magicks they had discovered and how they might use them in the future.

As the empire grappled with the aftermath of the Corruptor's War, the elves found themselves at a crossroads. While their victory cemented their reputation as formidable defenders, the empire's unity remained fragile. Vuhlen's divine wisdom and actions set the stage for a new chapter in the elven history, but the road to reunification and true cohesion would be fraught with challenges, both internal and external. The fate of the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire and the elves of Aerdth hung in the balance as they navigated the uncertain waters of the dawning world.

In the age following the Corruptor’s War, the strength of the elves continued to wane, and the elven empire faced internal strife and external threats.  The Erynor, feeling the encroaching changes and threats to their woodland sanctuaries, receded deeper into their secluded woodland halls. They sought to protect their sacred groves and preserve their ancient ways, distancing themselves from the turmoil of the outside world.

The Oror, bedeviled by the Corruptor's nature, found themselves haunted by the fear that the creature would eventually break free from its prison and wreak havoc once more. They believed that the Corruptor might hold the key to restoring their lost star, the Black Sun. This internal conflict led the Oror to be enveloped in a sense of uncertainty, struggling to find a path forward.

Retaining imperial lands became an impossibility for the weakened Vo-Tehlenreth. They were forced to cede vast territories to other mortal realms and relinquish their former dominance over certain regions.  The Vallinde, recognizing the necessity of peaceful coexistence, began to broker peace with the realms of humans and dwarves. Seeking allies to strengthen their position and prevent further conflicts, the Vallinde initiated diplomatic efforts and negotiations.

Meanwhile, the Ranor continued their relentless pursuit of knowledge and power, growing unchecked in their might. Their quest for supremacy led to increasing tensions with the other elven realms, culminating in a dramatic breaking of all bonds of kinship between the Vallinde and the Ranor. This marked the beginning of the generations-long conflict known as the War that Sank the Stars.  The war spilled over into all realms on the continent of Eredrest, engulfing the entire landmass in turmoil and bloodshed.

The Vallinde forged a crucial alliance with the Adhonian Realms, powerful human and dwarf kingdoms. This alliance proved to be a turning point, as the combined might of elves and Adhonians tipped the scales in their favor.  In their pursuit of victory, the Vallinde made great concessions to the Adhonians. They agreed to cede countless leagues of elf land in Eredrest to their allies and pledged to set free all enslaved peoples from their bonds. These agreements strengthened the alliance but further strained the elven empire's stability.

The allied forces ultimately managed to defeat the Ranor, but the cost was high. The once-mighty elven empire of old was irreparably shattered, and the elves' influence and dominion over the realm significantly diminished.  The War that Sank the Stars left lasting scars on the elven people, reshaping the balance of power and alliances across Aerdth. The elves were forever changed by these tumultuous events, and the once-glorious Vo-Tehlenreth Empire faced an uncertain future as it navigated the aftermath of the devastating conflict.

Their once-proud cultures lay in ruins, the very fabric of elven society torn asunder like the scarred battlegrounds upon which they shed the blood of their own kin. The elves had paid a heavy toll for the war they had recklessly wrought upon these lands, and the consequences were far-reaching.

No longer do most elves have a kingdom to call home, their empire now fractured and scattered. Across the realms, they wander as minstrels of their own fates. Some cling to the remnants of their glorious past, singing ballads of enduring wonders and majestic achievements of the elves. They hold onto the fading echoes of their once-mighty union, trying to revive the glories of old.

Amidst the ruins of their once-great empire, there are voices of dissent, loudly denouncing the weakened imperial remnant. These disillusioned elves decry the hubris and shortsightedness that led them to this precipice of ruin. Bitter and bereaved, they grapple with the weight of their own choices and the consequences they unleashed upon their kind.

Beyond the elven realms, other races look upon the elves with a mix of emotions. Some pity the elves for their drastic losses, for the broken fragments of a once-majestic civilization. They see a once-great people now adrift and struggling, their once-unassailable pride humbled. A compassionate few offer aid and understanding to a people who have suffered so greatly.

Yet, there are those from other races who meet the elves' plight with derision and reproach. They harbor resentment for the arrogance that fueled the elves’ conflict and, in their eyes, see them as deserving of the recompense bestowed upon them. To them, the elves' fall from grace is a cautionary tale, a reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition and pride.

The elves' path forward remains uncertain, and the echoes of their past actions linger in the winds of change. Some seek to rebuild, to mend the fractured unity of their kind and forge new alliances among mortalkin. Others cling to the embers of their glorious past, cherishing memories of a time when they were unrivaled in their grandeur.

As the world moves forward, the elves find themselves at a new crossroads, where their choices will shape their destiny for generations to come. Their scars run deep, but from the ashes of their lost empire, they can still rise renewed, finding strength in unity or embracing newfound paths of deliverance and redemption.
