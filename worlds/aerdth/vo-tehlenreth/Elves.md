# The Vo-Tehlenreth Empire

## The Elves of Aerdth

No single civilization in the histories of Aerdth has rivaled the power of the Vo-Tehlenreth Empire, the vast elven realms unified under the banner of Erulen, the first Master of Forms.

The empire's splendor knew no bounds as the Vo-Tehlenreth elves embarked on daring expeditions, scouring Aerdth far and wide in search of new discoveries. They established grand academies of knowledge and crafted towering libraries that housed ancient tomes and artifacts from distant lands. These centers of learning became renowned across Aerdth, attracting scholars, adventurers, and seekers of wisdom from all corners of the realm.
