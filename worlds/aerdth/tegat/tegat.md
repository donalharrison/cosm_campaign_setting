Begin entry exposition:

- Tegat was settled with the union of Nimakhin il’Umu [Mother of Moons] and Saba ul-Sury [He who seeks the Suns].  Their copulation birthed the Oasis around which the city was constructed.
- They welcomed other deities present in the desert as peers in their kingdom.
    - Ni'kha al-Banai, Master of Sands — patron of Consumption, Desolation, and Lost Things
    - Sadeva, Lady of Snakes — goddess of Survival and Rebirth.
    - Amnoon al-Ha, the Silent One — god of Secret
    - Ayamrit, the Dreaming God — goddess of Aspirations, Augury, and Illusion
    - Maha, the Desert Winds — god of Nature, the Winds, and Restoration
- Tegatians lived in prosperity for generations.  Two prominent subcultures, the Bhastir and Mataan, grew and colonized surrounding region.
- Saba departed in search of the Black Sun upon its disappearance in the Age of Revelation.  His dedicated study of solar patterns and mastery of the Suns’ energy would remain incomplete without the Black Sun’s presence.  Nimakhin remained sovereign in Tegat, awaiting her husband’s return.
- When the Corruptor’s hordes swept across Aerdth, one of its prime brood, Ixirazidra the Reaver, set her eyes on Tegat.  During the conflict, Nimakhin cleansed the dragon tyrant of her corrupted essence bestowing tranquility and reason upon the creature.  Ixirazidra pledged loyalty to Mother Moon who received her only as an equal.  Ixirazidra’s dragonkin legions remained loyal to her.  They learned how to survive and fight in the desert, becoming the Zidar-Alqat — an unassailable defensive force for Tegat, led by their champion dragon god.
- Ayamrit’s augurs gave prophecy of Nimakhin’s coming abdication.  The Mataan sultan and Dhaari of Bhastir angled for their ascent to rule in Tegat, but the Nimakhin birthed the Son of the Oasis, K’Hadir the Ma’jhalibh, who was to rule over Tegat until the Third Sun’s final setting.  With Tegat’s rule secure with her son and the city guarded by Ixirazidra and her warriors, Nimakhin departed on a pilgrimage to discover her husband’s fate.
- The Bhastir and Mataan grew resentful of the gods and made pacts with the Sand God to make the deserts impassable by the gods and imbue them with powers capable of assailing the gods.
    - Those gods who dwelled within Tegat were driven out to wander the wastes.
        - Sadeva was slain in the promenade of the Temple District
        - Maha was banished to the southern dunes.
        - The K’Hadir was mummified and entombed at the center of the oasis district, where he still stands today.

            - Cultural note: The Zidar-Alqat hold the Tegatians responsible for their patron’s fall.  Its devotees abandoned the city, vowing vengeance on the Sand God and his allies.  To this day they stalk the dunes dealing swift justice to any they deem unwelcome.
