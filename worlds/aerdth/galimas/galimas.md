# Galimas

At the height of the Corissian Empire, in the years before the Gale Barons of Szelyr shattered the Empress' grasp on the world, only one civilization is known to have broken the chains of Corissian service.  High Legionnaire Galim II witnessed the Empress grow greedy and power-hungry.  The specter of tyranny hung high on the banners of Coriss and weighed upon Galim's heart, leading to his defection from his station and oaths.

On the far continent of Etherind off the Ocean of Sildar, Galim II rallied those loyal to him in a colony and drew alliances with local inhabitnat.  Establishing a harbor from oppression, Galim amassed a considerable following and lead them in a devastating revolution against the Empress.  After Coriss had spent too many lives trying to leave Galim in ruin before he could take root, they had no choice but to grant his people liberty and leave them in a strained treaty.  Thus the Galimassian Empire was born, and there they stand in this Age of Conquest, vigilant against the scourges of Aerdth and beyond.

## The Stormcrow
#### Mantle of the Emperor or Galimas
Galim II was known for his pragmatism and unbending nature.  His military and political appraisals were careful and exacting, never sparing his troops or superiors the truth as he could measure it no matter how unpleasant the news.  Even in addressing the Empress directly Galim II provided his assessments without censor, often to her displeasure.  This tendency earned him the moniker of Stormcrow -- a harbinger of bad omens and ill-fates.  

Galim II was not deterred by this slight, instead embracing it fully as he saw fit only to draw conclusions objectively and practice radical acceptance of the state of thing, rather than rationalizing or attempting to justify falsehoods to satisfy his ego.  Historians cite that during Galim II's last war council with the Empress and his peers he stated plainly that 'if the crow warns of coming dooms, then it is my friend and I will greet it fondly, my sword at the ready.'

## The Dark Star Reborn
### The Prophecy of last age of Aerdth & the ending war
The ancient prophecy foretells that at the culmination of the ages of Aerdth, an Emperor shall rise to the throne of Galimas and become Champion of the Black Sun. This Emperor, known as the Dark Star Reborn, is prophesied to emerge during a time of unparalleled chaos and conflict, heralding the last great war that threatens to engulf the world in darkness.

As the final battle to determine the fate of existence unfolds, the Dark Star Emperor will stand as the last bastion of hope, holding aloft the banner of survival and fighting valiantly against the encroaching tides of destruction. In this ultimate confrontation, the Emperor's strength, wisdom, and unwavering resolve will be tested, as they strive to protect Aerdth and its inhabitants from obliteration, embodying the empire's enduring spirit and legacy in the face of apocalyptic doom.
