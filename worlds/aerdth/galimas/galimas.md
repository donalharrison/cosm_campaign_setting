# Galimas

At the height of the Corissian Empire, in the years before the Gale Barons of Szelyr shattered the Empress' grasp on the world, only one civilization is known to have broken the chains of Corissian service.  High Legionnaire Galim II witnessed the Empress grow greedy and power-hungry.  The specter of tyranny hung high on the banners of Coriss and weighed upon Galim's heart, leading to his defection from his station and oaths.  On the far continent of Etherind off the Ocean of Sildar, Galim II rallied those loyal to him in a colony and drew alliances with local inhabitnat.  Establishing a harbor from oppression, Galim amassed a considerable following and lead them in a devastating revolution against the Empress.  After Coriss had spent too many lives trying to leave Galim in ruin before he could take root, they had no choice but to grant his people liberty and leave them in a strained treaty.  Thus the Galimassian Empire was born, and there they stand in this Age of Conquest, vigilant against the scourges of Aerdth and beyond.

## The Stormcrow
#### Mantle of the Emperor or Galimas
Galim II was known for his pragmatism and unbending nature.  His military and political appraisals were careful and exacting, never sparing his troops or superiors the truth as he could measure it no matter how unpleasant the news.  Even in addressing the Empress directly Galim II provided his assessments without censor, often to her displeasure.  This tendency earned him the moniker of Stormcrow -- a harbinger of bad omens and ill-fates.  Galim II was not deterred by this slight, instead embracing it fully as he saw fit only to draw conclusions objectively and practice radical acceptance of the state of thing, rather than rationalizing or attempting to justify falsehoods to satisfy his ego.  Historians cite that during Galim II's last war council with the Empress and his peers he stated plainly that 'if the crow warns of coming dooms, then it is my friend and I will greet it fondly, my sword at the ready.'

## The Dark Star Reborn
### The Prophecy of last age of Aerdth & the ending war
The ancient prophecy foretells that at the culmination of the ages of Aerdth, an Emperor shall rise to the throne of Galimas and become Champion of the Black Sun. This Emperor, known as the Dark Star Reborn, is prophesied to emerge during a time of unparalleled chaos and conflict, heralding the last great war that threatens to engulf the world in darkness.  As the final battle to determine the fate of existence unfolds, the Dark Star Emperor will stand as the last bastion of hope, holding aloft the banner of survival and fighting valiantly against the encroaching tides of destruction. In this ultimate confrontation, the Emperor's strength, wisdom, and unwavering resolve will be tested, as they strive to protect Aerdth and its inhabitants from obliteration, embodying the empire's enduring spirit and legacy in the face of apocalyptic doom.

## Deliberations of the Second Age of Galimas
#### Principles of the Stormcrow & its Citizens

Upon Galim II's death, Galim III the second Stormcrow, maditated on his father's teachings and achievment.  Initially inetended as a journal of self-reflection, the young Emperor's advisors bid his writing be published and made freely available to the public.  These principles, known as the Deliberations, serve as philosophical guidelines for the citizens of Galimas, instilling values of strength, wisdom, integrity, and unity. They shape the cultural and ethical fabric of the empire, guiding individuals in their personal and collective endeavors.

#### **1. No Fate Shall Be Thrust Upon You**
"I value my Father. Of the many lessons he taught, that of greatest import concerns the obligation of all individuals to forge their own path. As he so stated, no fate shall be thrust upon you. No power of the Cosm shall bend thy will against its purpose, and should they try, then you shall rage against them ere their will be diminished or their providence is broken.‚Äù

#### **2. Strength Through Adversity**
"Adversity is the crucible in which our true strength is forged. Embrace challenges as opportunities to grow and refine your spirit. In the face of hardship, remain steadfast and unwavering, for it is through struggle that we achieve greatness and resilience."

#### **3. The Pursuit of Knowledge**
"Knowledge is the lantern that illuminates the path to wisdom. Seek out learning in all its forms, for ignorance is the root of fear and misunderstanding. Let curiosity guide you, and let the light of understanding dispel the shadows of doubt and ignorance."

#### **4. The Balance of Honor and Pragmatism**
"Honor is the foundation upon which our actions must rest, yet pragmatism is the bridge to effective action. Maintain integrity and uphold your principles, but be adaptable and wise in your decisions, ensuring that ideals do not blind you to reality."

#### **5. Mastery of the Self**
"The greatest victory is mastery over oneself. Discipline your mind, temper your emotions, and refine your body. In the symphony of life, let your thoughts be clear, your actions deliberate, and your spirit unyielding."

#### **6. Unity and Strength in Diversity**
"Strength arises from the unity of diverse elements. Embrace the differences among us, for they are the colors that paint the portrait of our empire. In our diversity, we find new perspectives, greater strength, and unbreakable bonds."

#### **7. The Art of Strategic Patience**
"Patience is the ally of the strategist. Do not rush headlong into conflict or decision; instead, observe, plan, and act with calculated precision. A well-timed move can achieve what a thousand hurried actions cannot."

#### **8. Embrace the Impermanence of All Things**
"All things are transient, and in this impermanence lies the beauty of existence. Accept the changing nature of life with grace and wisdom, for clinging to the past or fearing the future only hinders the present."

#### **9. Service to the Greater Good**
"True fulfillment lies in service to something greater than oneself. Contribute to the welfare of your family, your community, and your empire. In the selfless act of giving, you find purpose and strength beyond the individual."

#### **10. The Way of Peace and War**
"Peace is the desired state, but readiness for war ensures it. Cultivate peace within your heart and your land, but never let your guard down. Be prepared to defend what is precious, but do so with wisdom and restraint, knowing that true victory lies in the preservation of peace."

#### **11. Integrity in Action**
"Let your actions reflect your values and words. Consistency between thought, speech, and deed is the mark of true integrity. In all endeavors, act with honesty and sincerity, earning the trust and respect of others."

#### **12. The Legacy of Leadership**
"Leaders are the stewards of their people's future. Lead with compassion, wisdom, and strength, for your legacy will be the foundation upon which future generations build. Inspire through example, and guide with a vision that transcends your own time."
