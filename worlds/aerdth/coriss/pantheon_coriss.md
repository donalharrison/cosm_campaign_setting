# Corso

*The Bright Moon, Master of Skies*

Chief of Corissian deities, Corso embodies the virtues of Service, Oaths, and Peace.  Lord of the skies, he was tasked with mastering the nine winds to provide Coriss with self-sufficiency and merit in the eyes of the Masters of Air.  Scripture tells that Corso chafed under the responsibility to deliver salvation to Coriss, desiring instead to remain among the mortal with his love, the Lady Diar.  His betrayal of their vows fell too heavy on his heart and gave catalyst to his pursuits.  A tragic hero, Corso eternally sails the skies fulfilling his duty in hope of delivering a lasting peace to Coriss which he will never know himself.

# Diar

*The Gold Sun*

The patron of kismet, sacrifice, and redemption, Diar stands as the Queen of Coriss’ gods.  She is worshipped by those who have made great sacrifices and those seeking redemption for mistakes and wrongdoings.  The wife to Corso, Diar committed herself to ensuring he fulfilled his destiny at any cost.  While her husband sails the endless skies Diar dutifully awaits their reunion at the final days, ever seeking her own repentance and serving as harbor to those who  falter.

# Sende

*The Copper Sun*

Sende extolls the virtues of progress and liberty, and is goddess of cities.  Her worshippers follow a doctrine of collective action for the greater good and the modernization of cultural norms in service of advancing civilization.  Sende is depicted as a young woman slow to anger, viewing violence as a last resort or the tactic of dictators and oppressors.  She is contrasted in this regard by her twin sister Fria who champions violent action in service of independence and triumph.

# Fria

*The Iron Moon*

The icon of freedom from tyranny, Fria relentlessly seeks to break all bonds of servitude and right all injustice.  The goddess of triumph and violence inspires decisive action against all actors of oppression.  Fria is the patron of retribution and her blessings reach all those who have been wronged, delivering ruthless vengeance to those who abuse their power over others.  Despite her devotion and love for her sister Sende, Fria values progress and liberty only in reprisal to iniquity and the pursuit of personal independence.

# Mirhaz

*The Sword & Steel*

The greatest swordsman in all of history, Mirhaz represents the pursuit of mastery in all things, composure and audacity in the face of adversity, and unfailing courage in through the trials and burden of life.  Mirhaz stands apart from his peers in the pantheon, unquestionably the greatest combatant among them, but seldom using his skill with a blade to resolve conflict or oppose Coriss’ enemies, choosing instead to apply his art to empower the meek and seek the wisdom of steel. 

# Dato

*The Temptress*

The courtier of the Corssian pantheon, Dato draws her power from political maneuverings, deceitful or otherwise.  The patron of gossip, Dato’s followers believe that true fortune is found through commanding social hierarchy and the systems therein.  In matters of diplomacy and power, Dato holds no means unjustified.

# Biala

*The Starry Sky*

The goddess of romance and rivalry, Biala is the great seductress of Coriss notorious for her successful tempting of Lord Corso.  She is the keeper of secrets and mistress of trickery, worshipped by those who value personal beauty and desire the envy of others.  Though she is mostly viewed as a deceiver and an ill-omen, some hold her presence as a necessary evil and an embodiment of the folly of carnal desire.  Certain scholars hold that Biala is a guise of Diar, taken up to inspire Corso to fulfill his mandate by disrupting his devotion to her.

# Periono

*The Talent*

Periono represents the great depth of talent and creativity among Corissians.  Said to be naturally gifted in sorcery and art, Periono values fame, preeminence, and renown.  His tenets include competition and revelry in success.  Like their patron, Periono’s followers tend to avoid with social and political embroilment, choosing instead to pursue their crafts, sometimes to their own demise.

# Ferando

*The Silver Moon*

The god of knowledge and study, Ferando is patron to scholars and educators.  He is worshipped for his dedication to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosm, but has a reputation for inaction due to his command of vast lore both old an new.  Ferando embodies the Corissian view that scholarship leads to indecision and the pursuit of knowledge should be constrained only to the extent that it informs spirited action.
