The Kingdom of Coriss was the crown jewel of the Corissian Empire until the region was conquered by the Gale Barons of @Sz√©lyr.  The air masters eventually withdrew to their home plane returning Coriss to a state of semi-autonomy, managing diplomatic affairs through a princedom overseen by Szelyran envoys and consuls.  Most modern Corisians are content with the diplomatic arrangement and revere the office of Prince as an esteemed leader and dignitary of the Spheres, though some resent their perceived subjugation and aspire to rebellion that would see the despots driven out.  Generations spent co-mingling with elemental traditions and customs has nurtured a culture of tenacity and intrepidness famous for its sailors and swordsman.
