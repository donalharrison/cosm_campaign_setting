# Solhomme

## Realm of the King of Dawns

A bustling, cosmopolitan domain, Solhomme is regarded by historians and travelers as the most civilized Kingdom of record.  Regions across the world hear tale of the fabled King of Dawns — a direct descendant of Solhomme’s Chief Dieties, said to be incorruptible and inviolable by birthright.  Under the King’s executive stewardship, the commonwealth is governed by a representative assembly and maintained through a vast serfdom.  Famous for contributions to ecclesiastics, prolific in the art and institution of dueling, and preeminent in the areas of fashion and performance, Solhomme is at the forefront of civilization, a fact most personified by its capital city [Villée]() — the greatest city in this or any age.
