## Kemreit

The first Human-made wonders of record are the pyramids built atop the Wasemn oasis.  A great city-state within the midst of the Neba Desert grew around the Pharaoh’s monuments, known in today’s parlance as Kemreit.  The splendor of the Encircling Sands, Kemreit drew attention from countless travelers and foreign powers as the Pharaoh's people discovered new methods of science and magic in the safety and solace of the desert.  In the years before the Corruptor’s War when the Elven Scepters began to disperse, Queen Nimrielye led her elven host across the world to learn from Kemehrites and seek the Pharaoh Sitretiaa II’s hand.  Despite bearing no heirs before Sitretiaa passed from this world, Nimerielye, now Pharaoh Anok Sabé, sustains the realm to this day.

### Majaarij of Neb

Naturalists and wanderers, the Majaarij brave the hazards the Neban desert in a relentless practice of transmuting the barren and inhospitable into the fertile and generative.  While most view this existence as futile given the desert’s unchanging nature, a Majaarij’s labors are not enterprising, but rather of spiritual or philosophical practice.  To these practitioners the act of bringing viability to vacancy, even if temporary, is to impose agency upon an uncaring existence.
