## The Azurite Empire

Far east realm consisting of the two island continents of Nota and Janshir. In the Age of Severance, they were once one nation, but through meddlesome pacts with the Hellplanes, their homelands were torn apart.
They now practice a philosophy of mastering six core values, three of body three of mind, believing this is the only way to true enlightenment. Without constant practice in honing these tenets, you are doomed to face the same horrors your ancestors wrought. To build greatness and command of the physical and mental domains, you are prepared for the inevitable return of the Jigoma (Hell Lords). Depictions of devils and demons feature heavily in their mons and ceremonial practices as a reminder of the ever-looming threats from beyond the material plane. The Empire stands ready to take up arms against their ancestral nemeses when they once again move to despoil the world.

Imperial rule is determined by candidates who possess talents in specific tenets (i.e., ability scores).  Imperially recognized marriages are arranged according to complimentary strengths, most notably among the Emperor and Empress.  If a great warleader aspires to the throne, only a mate of suitable mental acuity can be courted.

The chief deity is an ancient emperor whose legend says he possessed mastery of all six domains, allowing both strength in conquest and acuity in peacetimes.  His complete enlightenment meant he sought no mate, nor did he require one, but this resulted in his line ending upon death.

When two other enlightened of this kind competed for the seat, the imperial advisors arranged the that the two be married. This union resulted in conquests expansions beyond the Empire as the two could not be outdone, always seeking further expansion in their power and reach. This culminated with other allied states / nations driving them into exile within their own lands, resulting in generations of isolationism.

There is also political and cultural tension between Nota and Janshir for the Imperial stations.  If both the Emperor and Empress are from one nation, then that nation's power will grow disproportionately to the other.  So when new candidates vie for the thrones, assassinations often take place to remove candidates that would unbalance the power scales.

Samurai and ninja wizards tried conquering the world, dabbling again into black magic.  The Emperor and Empress were entirely overpowered, uncontestable by most heroes and leaders of the time.  It took the alliance Adhonian realms (fantasy England-Germany), Solhomme (fantasy France), and Coriss (fantasy Italy), along with tneuous aliianes with the shattered elven empires and dwarven munitions, to hold back the Azurite Empire.  With the conquest halted, those folk from within the Empire who knew that the war was leading to another cataclysm worked to unmake their strengths from within, hoping to return to humble pursuits free from the costs of mortal blood.  Once weakened, the allied forces drove them back to Nota and Janshir, and the Corissians called upon the Gale Lords to sink the landbridge connecting Nota to the other mainland continents.

For generations the Empire was left under watchful eye without access to global politics and trade.  This exile from the global stage forced the Empire to devise its own ways of life and self-sufficiency.  When Gurren, the last King of Adhonia took the throne, he removed the embargos and sought alliance with the Azurite.  With only around a century of time outside of international oversight, most travelers from Janshir and Nota are deeply foreign are still met with suspicion if not hostility in foreign lands.
